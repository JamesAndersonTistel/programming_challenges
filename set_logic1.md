in whatever language you prefer, please implement some basic set theory.

for instance, set intersection:

A = (a,b,c)
B = (a,c,d,e)
set_intersection(A,B) = (a,c)

now there is set union:
A = (a,b,c)
B = (a,c,d,e)
set_union(A,B) = (a,b,c,d,e)

now there is set difference:
A = (a,b,c)
B = (a,c,d,e)
set_diff(A,B) = (b)

But! Here is the challenge! You cannot use the language's advanced set
data structures!  You can only use: functions, lists, conditionals and
loops! HINT: they can be done in any order, you can write helper
functions (with the same restrictions) and don't worry about the
order/sort of the output.
